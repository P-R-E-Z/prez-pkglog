# This APT hook for prez-pkglog is a work-in-progress.
# It is triggered after a dpkg invocation.
#
# To implement this, one would typically parse the dpkg log file to
# determine what was installed or removed.
#
# See: /var/log/dpkg.log
#
# Example of what needs to be logged:
# prez-pkglog install <package-name> apt --scope system
# prez-pkglog remove <package-name> apt --scope system
